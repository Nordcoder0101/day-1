    <p>(from the back of the box:)
    
    "You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike
    your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a
    wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of
    land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under
    your banner.
    
    But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as
    much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct
    buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your
    grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted."
    
    In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection
    of other cards the players can "buy" as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they
    play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path
    to the precious victory points by game end.
    
    Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes
    with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given playâ€”leading to immense variety. </p>
